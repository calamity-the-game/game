# CALAMITY, the virus game #

In our world we are constantly fighting against the most terrified virus that are trying to destroy everything that we humans build. We want to give knowledge to everyone, so that anyone can recognise a virus or know how to act depending of the virus at hand. This will be an educational game where the purpose is to share health information about virus.
